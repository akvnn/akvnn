## Hi, I'm Akvn 👋

I'm an AI developer focused on deep learning and generative AI. I also work as a platform engineer, building scalable infrastructure to deploy and manage models and applications in production. I have some research experience and a few academic publications, but I really enjoy building real-world things. Lately, I’ve been learning Rust and exploring GitOps. I’m also very interested in distributed systems and blockchains, particularly Solana.

## Fun Fact 🐳

I did a little bit of everything: deep learning, generative AI, web development, devops, data engineering, data analytics, and blockchain. 

The thing that never fails to fascinate me is infrastructure (platform engineering/devops), especially as it becomes more sophisticated.

## GitHub Stats

I am trying to find more time to contribute to OSS. I also make most of my commits using my work's GitHub account.
