## Hi, I'm Akvn 👋

I'm a platform engineer, building scalable infrastructure to deploy and manage production-grade applications and AI models. I have some research experience and a few academic publications, but I really enjoy building real-world things. I’m also very interested in distributed systems and blockchains, particularly Solana.

## Fun Fact 🐳

I did a little bit of everything: deep learning, generative AI, web development, platform engineering, data engineering, data analytics, and blockchain. 

The thing that never fails to fascinate me is infrastructure (platform engineering/DevOps), especially as it becomes more sophisticated.

## GitHub Stats

I am trying to find more time to contribute to OSS. I also make most of my commits using my work's GitHub account.
